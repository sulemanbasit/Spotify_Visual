# Spotify_Visual

## Objective:
Explore and Analyse the Spotify's 2024 Song list and provide insight using Excel. The current objective questions needed to be answered were (more can come later if revisited):
- What's the performance between explicit and non-explicit list?
- What non-explicit do well on compared to explicit?
- What's the criteria each track performs best on?
- Highlight track that scored highest in 1 or more criteria?
- What artists have the most songs on the list?
- Compare track that is 1st vs tracks that performed the best in each platform?

## Result:
- Added Country data using the ISRC information in the dataset.
- Extracted tracks with 1 or more best performance on a metric for further analysis.
- Created Pivot Charts to find the following:
-   Top 10 Artist with most songs on chart based on their best rankings
-   Top 10 Artist songs categorized in explicit and non-explicit and showcase their average track score
-   Top 10 Countries where songs were produced
-   Explicit and Non-Explicit songs split in metrics
-   Explicit and Non-Explicit songs split in rankings and track score

Incorporated the charts into a dashboard to display the result. Moreover, implemented a country slicer so the results can be curated based on the filter.
